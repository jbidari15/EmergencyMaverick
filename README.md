## About
The goal of our project is to make a decentralized energy neutral chatting network based on hardware  that would operate in areas where infrastructure is down.  Usually due to hurricane, earthquake or volcano activity. We have created the solution that can be set up within hours of accident and is cost efficient to deploy.

Our solution allows  people to send messages to each other, receive important information from  local authorities or rescue workers and notify their family about their safety. 

The network architecture is based on Bluetooth nodes. These nodes are simple-design mobile phone like devices with small screens and support for Bluetooth Mesh technology.
These low-cost devices (~ $3.5 per unit) are deployed over populated area by drones to achieve efficient distribution and excellent coverage of the area.  The example use case of deployment in an Indonesian village has been researched. We do graph optimization for cost-efficient distribution of the devices across the area that would secure stable coverage.

We have a 3D printed sample of the device with a Bluetooth Reed Board at the basis running latest modified version of Zephyr project. The Bluetooth Mesh decentralized network is deployed and can be tested for the use cases specified on the demo web page.  Data is gathered by the endpoint in Intel NUC and stored in backed. Frontend website is implemented  in Javascript, React and back-end with Node, MongoDB

PS Decentralized network is not meant to be used for avoiding  authorities or conducting illegal activities! :)
